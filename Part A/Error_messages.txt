Everything below the line of dashes is a valid error message.
If an input is valid (not one of the INV test cases) and you
output one of these allowed error messages, the autograder
will show you the error message, which will help you with
debugging.

The first error message is not in the "Errors you must check
for" section, but is still useful for debugging purposes.
